	<p>fullstack developer & startup tech advisor</p>
	<p>dedicated to life long learning, i have a curious mind and an open heart. passionate about fostering environmental and social impact, i actively seek collaborations with brands and projects that align with these values, while also supporting female-founded/led and LGBTQI+ initiatives. leveraging my expertise as a fullstack developer and active member of the queer and social tech community, i would love to work with you towards a better future.</p>
	<p>ps: i do know very well how to do large and lower case, i just find lower case writing more asthetic. probably because my mom used to only write upper case and i always had to read all my official school letters out loud to my teachers because they couldn't read her handwriting.</p>
