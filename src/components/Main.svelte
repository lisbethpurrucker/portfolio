	<h2 class="text-xl/8 font-bold">Yoga</h2>
	<p>The practice of yoga has been the biggest part of my life besides coding. When I first got into it in 2019, I had to step back from intense exercise and honestly just saw it as a way of movement without stretching my physical abilities. It quickly became an anchor in my life whenever I need grounding. I practice physical yoga on a daily basis, but more importantly do I practice yoga with every breath I take.</p>
	<p>In February 2024, I completed my 200 hours YTT in Rishikesh, India.</p>
